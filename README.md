This is kind of Shoping site for the customer to buy the Skirts.

I think that your project is mess and need to be clean. Also it was built on the Shopify 1.x version..
The clients want to add


Here are your requirements you sent me.

- Reviews for all product variants must be the same (since they're all supposedly one product from the perspective of the customer)
- After switching the color swatches the "others also bought" section is not converting to carousel
- Currency conversion is glitchy (switch between all variants and all sizes, sometimes the conversion stops working)
- Test + fix all glitches if there are any
- Teach me how to make this work for all new products Iâ€™ll add

First of all, please check the Review part.
I integrated all reviews related to yellow, red, blue skirts into one.
